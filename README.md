## Half-moon Datset
To get started, run the Test_halfmoon.m file.

The following data has to be classified -

### Notation followed in Plots

N - No. of training examples\
C - Upper limit on the lagrange multipliers, &alpha;\
d - distance between the two half moons as shown in the figure above\
C.A. - Classification Accuracy on the training dataset\
T.A - Testing Accuracy, that is the accuracy achieved on test dataset\
N<sub>s</sub> - No. of exemplars in the support\
N<sub>us</sub> - No. of examplars in the unbounded support\

### Results
